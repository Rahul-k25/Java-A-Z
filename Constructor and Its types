CONSTRUCTOR is use to initialize the object.

Each time an object is created using "new()" keyword at least one constructor is invoked to assign initial values( Default Constructor).

TYPES OF CONSTRUCTOR:-
(a) No-argument constructor (no parameter)
(b) Parameterized Constructor (with parameter)

** We don't write the return value statement but constructor constructor return current class instance.

**How constructors are different from methods in Java?

  (a) Constructor(s) must have the same name as the class within which it defined while it is not necessary for the method in java.
  (b) Constructor(s) do not return any type while method(s) have the return type or void if does not return any value.
  (c) Constructor is called only once at the time of Object creation while method(s) can be called any numbers of time.
